# Artificial Intelligence Mandy Idema

Welcome to my AI ecosystem!

Also check out this Youtube video i've made about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOd90p8jOGU&t=44s

I made an ecosystem AI in Unity. I wanted to create an enviroment just like nature but in Unity, and see how it balances itself out. Furthermore these are the animals that I have implemented into it:
* Carnivores (fox)
* Herbivores (Bunny)
* Plants

All of these artificial intelligences have different kinds of behaviours. The fox hunts the bunny, the bunny eats the plants etcetera. But I have a few different stats added to that as well:
* Hunger (Enabled hunting/searching for food)
* Energy
* Health

If you want more explanation about how the AI works and how you can improve it, please watch my Youtube video where I go in depth about the AI. You can download it for yourself and try it for yourself. Moreover, you are always allowed to improve it and make it your own.

You are free to use the behaviour scripts for the AI's as well. I've used the carnivore behaviour AI script for different enemy interactions in my other projects as well and with a bit of tweaking it works perfectly.
